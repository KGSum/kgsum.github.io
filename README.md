# International Workshop on Knowledge Graph Summarization (KGSum)
Workshop colocated at the 21st International Semantic Web Conference ([ISWC'22](https://iswc2022.semanticweb.org))

### Summary 
In recent years, there is an increasing interest in being able to programmatically generate summaries from the facts contained in a Knowledge Graph. Condensing relevant information into a few sen- tences, paragraphs or triplets is an emerging problem that remains to be solved as knowledge databases increase complexity and expand in size and domains. Knowledge Graph Summarization (KGSum) aims at pro- ducing concise but informative descriptions of entities from knowledge graphs that help users to efficiently access and distill valuable informa- tion from it. Conversational systems, question-answering services or any other method leveraging the narrative content around the entities in a knowledge graph will benefit from these techniques.


This workshop welcomes a wide range of papers, including full research papers, negative results, position papers, datasets, and system demos, that explore a variety of issues and processes related to the creation of summaries from knowledge graphs, such as question-answering, graph- to-text transformations, and entity summarization, among others. Also welcome are papers on resources (methods, tools, benchmarks, libraries, and datasets).

### Topics
- Importance/Role of Knowledge Graphs in the generation of summaries which express complex ideas
– Special features/metadata from Knowledge Graphs in order to generate co- herent multi-sentence summaries
– Extensions to current Knowledge Graphs to better support summaries
– Integration between Language Models and Knowledge Graphs
– Research work and initiatives related to verbalizing facts expressed through
subject-predicate-object triplets
– Benefits of incorporating automatic generation of textual summaries on
Knowledge Graphs
– Automatic generation of textual summaries as a way to measure the quality
of Knowledge Graphs
– How Knowledge Graphs in conjunction with textual descriptions can be used
to improve question-answering systems
– Use cases and applications for summaries from Knowledge Graphs
– Generating adaptive summaries from Knowledge Graphs so they suit the
needs of the different agents consuming it.


### Motivation
The growing size of knowledge graphs (KGs) necessitates summarizing as a means of assisting users in quickly accessing and distilling general knowledge [6], which is motivated by the discrepancy between individuals’ restricted informa- tion needs and the huge scale of KGs [3]. In other words, there is no easy way for humans to consume and navigate KG’s information, as evidenced by the Abstract Wikipedia1 initiative, so in this workshop we want to explore ways to make it more accessible and can support natural-language-based scenarios [2,5] such as conversational systems [4] or question-answering [1].


Researchers from multiple areas such as Semantic Web, Linked Data, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Entity Linking (EL), Knowledge Representa- tion and Reasoning (KRR), and other related fields will find opportunities to present and discuss about emerging research and applications, and to identify new opportunities for collaborations across disciplines.

### Workshop Format

We expect KGSum to be a full day workshop, divided in two sessions (around 10 submissions and 8 presentations are estimated), each one followed by a dis- cussion slot around the presented topics and a panel with a mixture of academic and industrial representatives. Accepted papers will have one of the following formats (Springer LNCS):    
– Full research papers (8-12 pages)
– In Use and Experience papers (8-12 pages) – Short research papers (4-6 pages)
– System/demo/Position papers (4-6 pages)


### Review Policy
Initial submissions to the Workshop track are reviewed with the double-blind review process, where the identity of both authors and reviewers are concealed. During the discussion of a submission in EasyChair, reviewers can refer to each other by their reviewer number on that submission’s review.


### Audience and Community
In this workshop we will discuss about state-of-the art techniques to produce summaries from the facts described in Knowledge Graphs, and enables a semantic- aware exploration of the knowledge inside it (e.g. question-answering services, conversational systems or entity summarization tasks).  


It is oriented to researchers and partitioners seeking algorithms and tools to explore Knowledge Graphs through distilled representations of their content. We expect an audience between 20-30 participants.

### Chairs

#### Carlos Badenes-Olmedo
Carlos Badenes-Olmedo is a post-doc researcher at the Onto-
logical Engineering Group (OEG) of the Universidad Polit ́ecnica de Madrid (UPM), and co-founder of librairy.eu, a technology-based spin-off that facil- itates the exploration of large document corpora. His research on advanced techniques for knowledge extraction from unstructured data combines ma- chine learning, natural language processing and Knowledge Graphs. Carlos was finalist for the Technology Innovation Talent Awards organized by the Madrid City Council in 2021 and awarded one of the ActuaUPM Prizes for Technological Innovation in 2020.

#### Jose Luis Redondo-García
Jose Luis Redondo-Garc ́ıa works as an applied scientist in the
Alexa Natural Language Understanding team, focusing on making Alexa smarter and available in an ever-growing number of languages. He investi- gates the impact of incorporating sophisticated data selection methods and neural-based models into voice-enabled interactions. His evolving research interests include Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Representation, and Semantic Web. His work on automatically collecting and ranking con- textual entities in international news obtained the Best Paper Award at the international conference KCAP 2015. Jose Luis has worked as a Postdoc with the Ontology Engineering Group at the Artificial Intelligent Faculty, Universidad Politecnica de Madrid. From 2012 to 2016 he pursued his PhD with the Doctoral School Telecom Paristech, in France.

#### Nandana Mihindukulasooriya
Nandana is a research scientist at IBM Research, Ireland. His
research is focused on Knowledge Representation, Knowledge Graphs, Nat- ural Language Processing, and Knowledge Base Question Answering, and Nuero-Symbolic AI. He has published more than 60 peer-reviewed papers in prestigious journals, conferences, workshops on topics related to Knowledge Graphs and NLP. Nandana has previously organized two ISWC Challenges at ISWC 2020/2021 and other workshops at ESWC and K-CAP.

#### Maribel Acosta
Maribel Acosta is an Assistant Professor at the Ruhr-University
Bochum, Germany, where she is the Head of the Database and Information Systems Group and a member of the Institute for Neural Computation (INI). Her research interests include KG sampling for summaries used during query processing and KG quality (completeness). More recently, she has applied Machine Learning approaches to these research topics. She has co-organiezed several workshops (e.g., CrowdSem@ISWC’13 and LDOW@WWW’19) and acted as Research Track Chair (ESWC’18, SEMANTiCS’19, ESWC’21) and PhD Symposium Chair (ESWC’20 and HCOMP’20).
