          <span class="text-primary">Knowledge Graph Summarization</span>
        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">co-located at the 21st International Semantic Web Conference

        </div>
        <p class="mb-0">In recent years, there is an increasing interest in being able to programmatically generate summaries from the facts contained in a Knowledge Graph. Condensing relevant information into a few sen- tences, paragraphs or triplets is an emerging problem that remains to be solved as knowledge databases increase complexity and expand in size and domains. Knowledge Graph Summarization (KGSum) aims at producing concise but informative descriptions of entities from knowledge graphs that help users to efficiently access and distill valuable information from it. Conversational systems, question-answering services or any other method leveraging the narrative content around the entities in a knowledge graph will benefit from these techniques. </p>
	    </br>
        <p class="mb-0">This workshop welcomes a wide range of papers, including full research papers, negative results, position papers, datasets, and system demos, that explore a variety of issues and processes related to the creation of summaries from knowledge graphs, such as question-answering, graph-to-text transformations, and entity summarization, among others. Also welcome are papers on resources (methods, tools, benchmarks, libraries, and datasets).</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">Motivation</h2>

        <p class="mb-0">The growing size of knowledge graphs (KGs) necessitates summarizing as a means of assisting users in quickly accessing and distilling general knowledge, which is motivated by the discrepancy between individuals’ restricted information needs and the huge scale of KGs. In other words, there is no easy way for humans to consume and navigate KG’s information, as evidenced by the <i>Abstract Wikipedia</i> initiative, so in this workshop we want to explore ways to make it more accessible and can support natural-language-based scenarios such as conversational systems or question-answering.</p>
	</br>
<p class="mb-0">Researchers from multiple areas such as <b>Semantic Web</b>, <b>Linked Data</b>, <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b>, <b>Entity Linking (EL)</b>, <b>Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR)</b>, and other related fields will find opportunities to present and discuss about emerging research and applications, and to identify new opportunities for collaborations across disciplines.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">Call for Papers</h2>
		<p class="mb-0">KGSum will be a half-day day workshop, divided in two sessions (around 10 submissions and 8 presentations are estimated), each one followed by a discussion slot around the presented topics and a panel with a mixture of academic and industrial representatives. Accepted papers will have one of the following formats (Springer LNCS):
		</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p class="mb-0">Full research papers (8-12 pages)</p></li>
          <li><p class="mb-0">In Use and Experience papers (8-12 pages) – Short research papers (4-6 pages).</p></li>
          <li><p class="mb-0">System/demo/Position papers (4-6 pages).</p></li>
        </ul>
	</br>
		<p class="mb-0">Initial submissions to the Workshop track are reviewed with the double-blind review process, where the identity of both authors and reviewers are concealed. During the discussion of a submission in EasyChair, reviewers can refer to each other by their reviewer number on that submission’s review.</p>
	</br>
		<p class="mb-0">In this workshop we will discuss about state-of-the art techniques to produce summaries from the facts described in Knowledge Graphs, and enables a semantic- aware exploration of the knowledge inside it (e.g. question-answering services, conversational systems or entity summarization tasks).</p>
		<p class="mb-0">It is oriented to researchers and partitioners seeking algorithms and tools to explore Knowledge Graphs through distilled representations of their content. We expect an audience between 20-30 participants.</p>
